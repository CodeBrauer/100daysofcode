# #008 2017-01-08: Save HTML Table as CSV

This script will search the table on the page, format all rows/cells into a CSV formatted string and download it as CSV file. The file is formatted with semicolon as delimiter and all columns are wrapped in double quotes.

In my test, the file can be opened correctly in Excel (v2011, macOS).
