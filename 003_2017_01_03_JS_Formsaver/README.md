# #003 2017-01-03 Tuesday: Formsaver (JS)

**Features:**

- Saves any input/changes on an form in localStorage
- Restores the values on page load

**Description:**

Remember when you just filled out a form and you just closed your browser and your whole form data is gone?

So some browsers already can restore form values, but this doesn't work anytime. So with Formsaver it saves all values in your browsers [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - where data has no expiration time.

You can turn off your computer and the data is still saved in your browser.<br>Just load the page and Formsaver will load the data in the fields.
